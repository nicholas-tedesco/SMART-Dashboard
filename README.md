# clinical-trial-dashboard

Objective: create interactive dashboard in R Shiny to keep track of clinical trial progress

Specifics: 
- screening and enrollment: keep track of patient
- treatment assignment: randomly assign patient to certain treatment plan + visualize current treatment distribution
- assessment times: relative to 
- results: summarize key biomarkers (C-reactive protein), treatment response stats by treatment class

Context: 
- NOTE: all data in this version is synthetic to avoid any issues with data confidentiality
- this dashboard was created during my time as a statistician at the University of Michigan School of Medicine
- still trying to figure out a way to visualize the dashboard... maybe i'll put in a link in the near future, and host it on a website? also considering github pages

Credits: 
- this project was heavily inspired by Jen Thompson (https://jenthompson.me/2018/02/09/flexdashboards-monitoring/); in particular, the screening & enrollment tab is very similar to hers !
