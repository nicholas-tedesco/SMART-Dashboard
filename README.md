[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=R,html,css&theme=light)](https://skillicons.dev)

## Overview

This dashboard was created to track the results of a clinical trial at Michigan Medicine. Specific functions of the dashboard include: 

- screening and enrollment: keep track of patient screening / enrollment counts, summarize exclusion reasons 
- treatment assignment: randomly assign patient to certain treatment plan + visualize current treatment distribution
- assessment times: calculate assessment times relative to treatment start; alert user of upcoming assessment by highlighting cell in red
- results: summarize key biomarkers (ex: C-reactive protein), treatment response stats by treatment class

Other Notes: 
- all data included in this repo and within the screenshots is synthetic
- this project was heavily inspired by Jen Thompson (https://jenthompson.me/2018/02/09/flexdashboards-monitoring/)
